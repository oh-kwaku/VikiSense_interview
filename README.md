I used visual studio project template which already has WeatherForecastController.
- To see query params logging, go to ```/WeatherForecast/summaries?itemsCount=6```
- To see the global exception middleware response, supply an invalid index to the summaries endpoint example: ```/WeatherForecast/summaries/-1```
